🚀 Project Evolution

This repository is the ongoing RESTful Web API evolution of my previous project, [Worker-Availability-Checker](github.com/VladyslavShaposhnikov/Worker-Availability-Checker). I have transitioned the original console application into a web-based service to provide better accessibility, scalability, and performance.
